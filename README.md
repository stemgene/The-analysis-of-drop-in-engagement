# The-analysis-of-drop-in-engagement

## The problem
There is an unexpected downturn in Yammer's user engagement in the month of August, 2014. I have been tasked with identifying the cause of the drop in engagement and must recommend a time-efficient solution.

### How to define engaged user:
Email reaction: 'sent_weekly_digest', 'email_open', 'email_clickthrough','sent_reengagement_email'
Web or APP reaction: 'login', 'home_page', 'view_inbox', 'like_message', 'send_message','search_autocomplete', 'search_run', 'search_click_result'

### Possible reasons:
* Charge fee since August.
* The target users have same groupthink, e.g., holidays. The product faces to companies, maybe lost big companies.
* Portal issue causes some users can't access, e.g., firewall, proxy
* New product from competitor shows up.
* Product issue may cause user leave.
* Fake prosperous before August. It may happen in two situations, short term promotion or fake data.
* Changes of metrics, some traffic from original engagement is split to other channels.
